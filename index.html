																<p> This was my project for my internship at The Woodbridge Group. The system that I was able to build for the company served the purpose of being
																	able to seperately test chemical pourheads that are used on the company's plant line. By being able to test the pourhead offline, it allowed for 
																	the ability to gather data such as performance capabilities and perform initial wear analysis that would have otherwise been impossible. This
																	newly collected information allowed for advance modifications and improvements to be made to future pourheads and significantly improve the 
																	performance efficiency and cost effectiveness of the plant line. 
																</p>

																<p> I was fortunate enough to be tasked of being the primary project coordinator in which I was able to do tasks ranging from creating P&ID's, to conceptualizing them
																	into 3D CAD models, all the way to the final prototype build. I was also forturnate to have a very supporting team who guided me through the process and helped
																	push the project into reality. I was able to learn a lot about the production process ranging from the logistics, to the design, and troubleshooting as well
																	as management. Although I cant go into too much detail about the system itself due to the NDA, the overall experience was great as I got to work alongside
																	many awesome co-workers and aquired many new skills.

															<p> This was my project for my internship at Nytric ltd. I was tasked to design and create a LED optimization strategy for an optical imaging touchscreen system. 
																The goal of doing the optimization is to improve on the current and future touchscreen systems by enhancing performance and minimizing the cost of production. 
																To do this, a mathematical model to describe and simulate the emitted light ray behavior from the LEDs is created to calculate for the final detection signals, 
																which directly corresponds to LED performance. 
															</p>
		
															<p>The model attempts to calculate for an extremely large amount of scenarios and combinations of LED arrangements in order to produce an as accurate result as possible. 
																This includes calculations for over 100 different LED positions and 13 different types of LEDs.  Because of the large amounts of calculations needed, 
																VBA programming is used to aid in automating and ultimately speeding up the calculation process. 
															</p>
		
															<p>Taking into account of the optical behavior of light such as refraction and loss of intensity when travelling between different light mediums, the light path and resulting
																detector signals for a range of angles of each LED were able to be calculated. Depending on if the resulting signals were up to specified standards, an ideal angle and the 
																type of LED is chosen which maximizes the touchscreen performance while minimizing the cost.
															</p>
		
															<p>The result of this optimization was a reduction in cost of more than 50% due determining the fact that initial, more expensive LEDs designed to be used in the current model were 
																over performing and a cheaper alternative could be used instead. This allows future products and models to be much more intuitively designed and optimized which greatly increase 
																overall efficiency in the research and design procedures.

											<h3 class="major">Arduino Robot Manipulator</h3>
											<p> A robotic arm utilizing micro servo motors to obtain a full range of motion with the ability of being able to remotely grab objects .</p>

												<div class="inner">
													<h2>Arduino Robot Manipulator</h2>

													<p>The idea behind this project was to utilize the arduino uno microcontroller to create a robotic arm. The main 
													body of the arm is made from 3 segments of acyrlic each attached to a servo motor. This allows for a wide range motion
													of the arm making it more dynamic. The claw is also operated by a servo motor which allows the ability to control the amount
													of grip used. In order to control the actual arm, a seperate controller consisting of potentiometers is made.</p>
													<img src="images/controller1.jpg" style="float:left;width:300px;height: 250px;margin-right:20px;">
													<p>The idea behind the controller is for the primary arm to mimic the movement of the controller. This was done by using
														potentiometers on the controller in places of where the servo motors would be on the actual arm. The potentiometers parameters
														were mapped in accordance to the adjusted angular movements of the servo and the re-written as the servo values. This ensured
														that the servo would move the exact amount of degrees that the potentiometer moved.
													</p>
													<p style="margin-top:4em;">Overall, the project turned out successful. One of the issues that was encountered was a jitter of the motors when the 
														arm was operating. This turned out to be caused by a lack of current applied to the motors. The primary power source is only 5V,
														which wasnt enough to properly power all 4 servo motors. The issue was fixed by adding an additional 5V power source directly connected to
														the breadboard.</p>
													<img src="images/arm2.jpg" style="float:right;width:300px;height: 350px;margin-left:20px;">

													<p>As you might tell, the overall project was put together using non-ideal materials and the overall build is pretty rough. This was unfortunately
														due to a tight time constraint I had as well as a lack of access to services such as a 3D printer or laser cutter. However, I plan to revisit this
														project in the future to refine the build as well as add other functionalities such as a record and play ability.

											<h3 class="major">Handwriting Recognition Software</h3>
											<p>Machine learning program to recognize handwritten number</p>
											<!-- <a href="#" class="special">Learn more</a> -->

											<nav id="overlay3">
													<div class="inner">
														<h2>Handwriting Recognition</h2>
	
														<p>This project was meant to be my introduction into the world of machine learning. This simple program was built using Python and by
															utilizing the Keras library and Tensorflow framework. The idea is to train an AI to be able to recognize handwritten numbers
															taken from a large dataset, specifically, the well known MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of a training set composed of 
															60,000 examples as well as a test set of 10,000 examples. </p>

														<p>	For this specific project, a simple neural network composed of only 3 layers will be used: the input layer, a single hidden layer,
															and the output layer. First, images taken from MNIST dataset are 28x28 in size, resulting in a total of 784 pixels. Each of these
															pixels have to be read into the neural network which results in having 784 nodes for the input layer. Each node will take in a 
															value ranging from 0 to 255, which represents the greyscale value of the pixel. The model will be trained on this basis as to recognize patterns
															between the pixels and greyscale value in order to accurately predict numbers.</p>
															
														<p>	To put it simply, a nerual network works
															by interpreting all the inputs and assigning them a weighted connection which is then fed into the hidden layer. Here, each node with its own weighting 
															(known as its bias) will consist of a value resulting from summation of the weighted results from each of the input nodes plus the bias value. This 
															process is basically done again by feeding the new value along a connection with a weight, to the output layer in which each node also as a bias. Depending 
															on the final value of the output nodes, the model will make a prediction on the the final result.</p>
														
															<center><img src="images/NN2.jpg" style="width:600px;height: 325px;"></center>

														<p style="margin-top:2em;">In my case, there are 10 ouputs, each representing a number from 0 to 9. Depending on the final value of the output nodes (1 node with the value 1
															while others are 0), the model will predict a number to go along with the image fed in. In order to train the model, a test set conisting of 60,000 images is fed into the 
															intitial neural network which conists of randomly assigned weights. In order for the model to "learn", it makes a prediction based on its randomly assigned weightings and 
															then compares to see if the prediction it made was correct. If the prediction is wrong, the model goes back and readjusts the weightings and bias to be able
															to make a more accurate prediction next time. This process is known as "back-propagation" and is repeated several times using the thousands of training images. In order to
															determine the proper weighting to be assignded, the model uses gradient-descent, which is an optimization algorithm and in my case, I will be using the Adam optimizer.  
														</p>

														<p> To make things easier, the Keras library is used which has functions that allow for easy building of neural networks and implementation of opitmizers.
															The result is a program that is simple in code, but complex in theory. The model is trained by passing the entire dataset through 10 times (each time is called an "epoch")
															before the final pass which shows how accurate the model is.
														</p>

															<center><img src="images/epochs.jpg" style="width:600px;height: 325px;"></center>

														<p style="margin-top:2em;"> As seen, after just 10 epochs, the model was able to achieve an accuracy of 98% in predicting the correct number. Although 98% is already
															pretty impressive, I hope to come back and instead of using the Keras models, I plan to make my own neural network to further improve the results.

														<h2>Snake Game AI</h2>
	
														<p>This project is still in progress of being made. I plan to have it done relatively soon, but I am currently quite busy
															with school. The goal however, is to build a model which is able to play snake based on Reinforcement Learning. This model can be 
															interpreted to be analagous to the concept of "trial and error". Basically, in this program, the AI will continously play the game snake
															over and over again, in which each time it will use the previous run to determine which actions produced the best result and then refine these 
															actions to improve the performance.
